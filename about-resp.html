							<article>
							â€œJamie and Lena met on University where they both had studied business management. It was love at first sight for them as cliche as this may sound. Ever since the two laid eyes on each other there was no going back, everything from there on was based on their relationship and building a great one too. The couple has been through it all, the highs, the lows and the lowest, but nothing could stop them from creating a successful life together.

							<br><br>

							The couple eventually graduated university and decided to start a small business together. At first it was tough coming out of school and taking on something as big. Despite the struggles, the business became a huge success and is still going strong. It was at this point where the couple decided to settle down and tie the knot.

							<br><br>

							Explorer Tribe began shortly after and was created for the purpose of inspiring the public only. The couple knew travelling was all they really wanted and basically what every aspect of their beings yearned for from the get go. The blog now, intends to share experiences, travel, every detail of what the couples relationship is based on in hope to inspire a stronger love to everyone.
