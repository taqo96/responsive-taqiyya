							<h1>STORY TIME</h1>
							<h2>By Jamie</h2>
							<h3>Monkey Bread?</h3>
							<p>Whilst travelling Italy this year Lena and I had come across this really cool bakery in one of the off-roads in Siena. Here the menu offered monkey bread, this being something I had not tried out , yet alone even heard of.<br>

							My first thoughts were, “is monkey bread made of monkeys or is it the kind of bread monkeys are fed”. Lena found this extremely funny and couldnt contain herself. To this day she holds the story against me and everytime we come around family and friends she'll be like, "but did yu know Jamie wasnt aware that monkey bread existed". <br>

							My experince with it was definitely out of this world though. A combination of a sweet, sticky, gooey pastry made from little balls of dough rolled in cinnamon sugar and baked together in a bundt pan. You literally have it for breakfast, lunch or supper! Its just too good. A little bit of heaven on earth. Anyway, Lena and I enjoy sharing with you all our experiences whilst travelling and good food, good food is something we cant leave out! #Monkeybreadforlife.
